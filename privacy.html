                <h4>1. Introduction</h4>

                <p>Joy Coordinate (“Studio” “us”, “our” or
                  “we”)&nbsp;develops and publish games for mobile devices. This Privacy
                  Policy (this “Policy”)&nbsp;&nbsp;describes&nbsp;the ways we collect,
                  store, use, and disclose the information, including personal information, and data
                  that our users (“users” or “you”) provide or we collect in
                  connection with the Studio website available at&nbsp;<a href="http://skinnerboxlab.fun">thesneakygames.com</a>&nbsp;and any Studio game
                  provided on a mobile platform (each a “Service,” collectively, the
                  “Services”).&nbsp;Additionally,&nbsp;this Policy describes your rights
                  and choices concerning your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information and data
                  collected or received by Studio through your use of the Services.&nbsp; Studio is
                  not responsible for the actions of individuals with no relationship to Studio or
                  third-party companies, the content of their sites, the use of information or data
                  you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer.&nbsp; Any link to
                  those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those
                  individuals or companies.</p>

                <p>If you do not want Studio to collect, store, use, or share your information in the
                  ways described in this Policy, you should not use our Services.</p>

                <h4>2. Information and Data We Collect from You and How We Collect It</h4>

                <p>When you use our Services, you may give us your contact information directly on our
                  website, generally your name and email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Information Collected by Customer Support:</p>

                <p>When you ask for assistance from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store
                  the contact information you provide (generally your name and e-mail address),
                  information about your gameplay or activity on the Services, and your user-name or
                  ID number. We will also store the correspondence and any information contained
                  within.</p>

                <p>Technical and Usage Information:</p>

                <p>When you access our Services, we may collect (i) certain technical information about
                  your mobile device or computer system, including IP Address, mobile device ID (IDFA,
                  Google Advertising ID or other identifiers), and the version of your operating
                  system; and (ii) usage statistics about your interactions with the Services. In
                  certain Services we will create and assign to your device an identifier that is
                  similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your
                  device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose
                  to provide, such as username, character name, or e-mail address. We may also access
                  your contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in the Services.&nbsp;
                  This information is typically collected through the use of third-party mobile device
                  software development kits.&nbsp;We may occasionally send you push notifications
                  through our Services to send you game updates, high scores and other service-related
                  notifications that may be of importance to you.&nbsp; You may at any time opt-out
                  from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level
                  through your settings.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Use of Your Information by Others</p>

                <p>Third Party Services.&nbsp;We may provide your information to third party companies
                  to perform certain services, including but not limited to hosting services, payment
                  processing, analytics, customer service and to assist us in our marketing efforts.
                  Where we share your information with third-party service providers and business
                  partners, we ensure that we have appropriate agreements in place to protect your
                  information as required by applicable data protection laws.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Advertising. To the extent we display advertising in our Services, we may allow
                  advertising networks of our affiliates and partner networks to collect information
                  about your mobile device to enable them to serve targeted ads to you. Such mobile
                  device data includes the following:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Device make, model and operating system;</li>
                  <li>Device properties related to screen size &amp; orientation, audio volume and

                <p>You may also limit data collection by third parties by using your mobile device
                  settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising
                  from appearing in your browser or applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may make the ads you
                  see less relevant to your interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, please not that if you
                  use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, or use a different
                  mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.</p>

                <h5>5. Specific Provisions for EU Individuals&nbsp;</h5>

                <p>Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time, you may
                  contact Studio at the address provided in the “Contact Studio” section
                  herein and request to access the personal data that Studio holds about you. Studio
                  may need to ask you to provide certain information to make sure you are who you
                  claim to be. If you find the information on your account is not accurate, complete
                  or updated, then please provide Studio with the necessary information to correct
                  it.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Withdrawing Your Consent. Contact us if you would like to withdraw your consent to
                  the processing of your personal data. Exercising this right will not affect the
                  lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Erasing or Restricting Access to Your Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request to
                  delete or restrict access to your personal data. We may postpone or deny your
                  request if your personal data is in current use for providing Services or for other
                  legitimate purposes, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so
                  and why.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Transferring your Personal Data (Otherwise known as Your Right to Data
                  Portability).&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the right to receive your personal data that you
                  have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the
                  right to transmit that data to another party of your choice, where technically
                  feasible. However, this right shall not apply where it would adversely affect the
                  rights and freedoms of others.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Right to Make Complaint: if you consider that our processing of your personal data
                  infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a
                  supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU
                  member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the
                  alleged infringement.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>If you have any concerns about the way we process your personal data, you are welcome
                  to contact our data protection officer at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:skinnerboxlab@gmail.com">skinnerboxlab@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;or
                  write to us at the address set forth in the “Contact Studio” section. We
                  will look into your request and make good faith efforts to resolve any concern you
                  may have.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>6. Security Safeguards.&nbsp;</h4>

                <p>Studio takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access
                  or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we make
                  good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure
                  operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the
                  absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage on our
                  systems.&nbsp; Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our
                  network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
                  third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this
                  information.&nbsp; We do not warrant or represent that your information will be
                  protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of
                  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
                  however.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <h4>7. <strong>Data Retention</strong>.&nbsp;</h4>

                <p>Studio retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide you Services,
                  unless we are required by law to delete or if Studio accepts your request to delete
                  the information. We will also retain and use your personal data as necessary to
                  comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
                  agreements.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>8. Our Policy Regarding Children.&nbsp;</h4>

                <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16
                  or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.&nbsp; If you are under 16,
                  please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name,
                  address, telephone number, or email address.&nbsp;No one under the age of 16 may
                  provide any personal data.&nbsp; In the event that we learn that we have collected
                  personal data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly
                  as possible.&nbsp; If you believe that we might have any information from or about a
                  child under the age of 16, please contact us.</p>

                <h4>9. Transfer of Personal Data Outside Your Country.&nbsp;</h4>

                <p>We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to
                  other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other
                  countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and
                  jurisdictions may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction,
                  and we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of
                  information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you,
                  including personal data, as described in this Policy.</p>

                <h4>10. Lawful Basis for Processing.&nbsp;</h4>

                <p>On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the
                  performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide the Services
                  to you.&nbsp; We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries
                  concerning our products and services.</p>

                <p>On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law.&nbsp; We may
                  also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the
                  interests of a third party.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud
                  prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to
                  advertisers and publishers; where&nbsp;these interests&nbsp;are not overridden by
                  your data protection rights.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no other lawful basis
                  for such processing, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from
